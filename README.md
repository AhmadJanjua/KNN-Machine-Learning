# KNN-Machine-Learning: From December 2021
 Does data visualization and create KNN classifier on manually collected data.

# Data
 The data collected was from people I knew personally, so the data is not representative of the general population. However, the data does have clear distinctions with some overlap allowing for a useful test on how to use KNN classifiers.

 # What is KNN classifier?
 A k nearest neighbours is a way to classify an input into a category by using the data points proximity to other data points as a marker for the class that the input belongs to. It is a very simple method to achieve classification.
